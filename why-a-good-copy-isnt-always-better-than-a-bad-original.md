**'Why a good copy isn't always better than a bad original.'** <br>
Weird sentence right? Because it's a take on the dutch phrase: "Better a good copy than a bad original." (Beter goed gejat dan slecht bedacht). Now I am not saying it's bad to copy someone else's work.

*This is all my opinion, it's subjective. I may not be right about everything. But this is something I want to get of my chest.*

### Young me loved art.
So when I first started learning design, I tried to find as much inspiration as I could and try to copy that. Good way to start practising but not a good way to design for clients. I was overthinking my designs way too much, it needed to look awesome! Had to be the best somebody has ever seen, maybe revolutionary. How did that work out you think? I was way too stressed and my designs looked weird, I tried to make art instead of design. So for whoever is reading this art =/= design. Pick one. Design is a means of getting your goal across to the users. If it doesn’t work but looks cool as hell it’s art.

So what has this to do with copying work? Well as I said if it’s not working for the users it’s not good design. And if you copy someone’s design it probably won’t work in your case.

#### Why?
Why not, it worked for them right? Well yes that’s true, and it worked for them because they did research to the users they are trying to reach, what they like & tested it with them (or they got damn lucky, but still that’s just good working art).
So if you copy what they did, who says your audience isn’t completely different than theirs, did you look into that?

It’s important to understand who you are designing for, when they are using your application/website.

### Who has the longest ****?
Excuse my french. How many people ask for design inspiration on forums like reddit, and people redirect them to dribbble, awwwards.com and particular websites that they really like. That’s cool yes do up some inspiration for the visuals what they made. But for the love of god don’t just copy their UI just because it looks good.

Take a look at this image, it’s a new design style called neomorphism:
<figure class="image">
<img src="https://api.gijsbertcharles.com/uploads/neomorphism_6aaf52552f.jpeg" alt="Neomorphism a style that's terrible" />
<figcaption>IT’S ALL ONE COLOR WITH A LITTLE ORANGE.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now I’m hoping this design style will never make it to the shelfs. Because just looking at this for longer than 5 seconds makes me hurt my eyes, and get an instant headache. (without talking about performance with all the bazillion shadows going on). It’s trying to be super subtle, and because of that it’s a nice where’s Waldo UI going on. Want to control the temperature? Yeh it’s that tiny icon with the 12px font saying ‘Temperature’. Imagine someone having to use this as a real app, probably not a happy customer.

*I must admit the hierarchy is right, the primary actions are the largest. But there isn’t a lot to work with anyway.*

And yet everyone on forums such as Reddit/Instagram is cheering this on, with only one argument: “LOOKS A W E S O M E!”, why though? I see tutorials in instagram popping up left and right on how we should all create UI design. Saying ok step 1: draw a circle, step 2: fill it in. blah blah blah. ([this](https://www.instagram.com/ui_gradient/)). Now there are some very good examples in there, they are mostly tips for beginners. And then there are posts 'how to make this super cool looking thing I made' tutorials.

People are making this inspiration just to show their peer designers who has the longer d*ck. It's not designed for users it's designed for other designers. Why are people investing all this effort into designing for their peers? If only they would open up a book like [this one](https://refactoringui.com/book/) (Not sponsored, just a fan). I'm not saying copy this entire style, but it is a good base for making your UI accessible for your users. The book helps you design with a strategy not just talent. In the end design is 10% luck, 20% skill, 15% concentrated power of will, 5% pleasure, 50% pain. (and 100% reason to remember the name, thanks [Fort Minor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDvr08sCPOc)).

### Art isn’t bad.
Let me calm down, I really think artists need to exists. Wouldn’t the web look boring if we all followed a particular set of rules. I just want people to use their own brain and move inside the user for a second when creating their UI/UX. Websites like [Awwwards.com](https://awwwards.com) are indeed fun places to explore. But take a step back when viewing it. Say to yourself okay this looks cool, but how would this work in a real life example? If you can say yes this would work, than excellent! But if you get lost on their website, don’t even know what the purpose of the website is when browsing it.. Then I want you to think to yourself: “Why is this website getting an 8 in usability & content”.

#### So Gijs, what is the right way then?
Good question! And it’s mainly learning from your mistakes, make them, make them a lot. (This post maybe even my mistake). Do not be afraid to make mistakes. Yes copy others, but also study what you are copying and why it would work. Study why their designs look/feel better, most of the time they have something in common like more whitespace.

And best of all test it! You can’t know everything and the only way to find out if you did the right thing is testing it.
